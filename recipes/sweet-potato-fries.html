    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These addictive seasoned "fries" are actually baked, but we promise you won't miss the grease. The spice mix –
        garlic powder, paprika, salt and black pepper – can be used on regular potatoes as well (you'll just need to
        increase the baking time a bit).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 400 degrees Farenheit.</li>
        <li>Cut the sweet potatoes into sticks ¼ to ½ inch wide and 3 inches long, and toss them with the oil.</li>
        <li>Mix the spices, salt and pepper in a small bowl, and toss them with the sweet potatoes. Spread them out on 2 rimmed baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake until brown and crisp on the bottom, about 15 minutes, then flip and cook until the other side is crisp, about 10 minutes. Serve hot with dip of choice.</li>
    </ol>
